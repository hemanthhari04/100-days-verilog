💡 100 Days of Verilog 🚀
Welcome to the 100 Days of Verilog Challenge!

This repository is a part of my journey to master Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language), focusing on designing and simulating digital circuits over a span of 100 days.

📚 What You’ll Find Here
Day-by-Day Progress: Daily implementations, from basic gates to advanced digital designs.
Code Examples: Verilog code for various projects and modules.
Simulations: Testbench files and waveforms to validate each design.
Learning Notes: Key concepts, challenges, and insights gained along the way.
🛠️ Topics Covered
Combinational and Sequential Logic Design
Adders, Subtractors, Multiplexers, Decoders
FSMs (Finite State Machines)
Ripple Carry Adders and Arithmetic Circuits
Memory Elements and Timing Analysis
Advanced Design Projects
🔗 Why This Challenge?
The goal of this challenge is to build a strong foundation in Verilog, develop a structured workflow, and contribute to meaningful projects in VLSI and digital design.
